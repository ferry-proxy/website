Usage: ferryctl control-plane pre-join [command] Aliases: pre-join, p, pj, join, j Available Commands: direct Clusters can reach each other tunnel Control plane can't touch the data plane Flags: -h, --help help for pre-join There are currently two ways to join
direct tunnel direct # It is suitable for the case where the network between clusters is interoperable, and there is no need to do penetration or proxy operations.</description></item><item><title>Quick Start</title><link>https://ferry.zsm.io/docs/user/quick-start/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ferry.zsm.io/docs/user/quick-start/</guid><description>Quick Start # Prepare at least two clusters for demonstration
Can be a cluster of one node or a cluster of Kind but at least two.
Download ferryctl # ferryctl is the installation and operation tool for ferry
A ferryctl needs to be installed for each cluster&amp;rsquo;s control node

Initialize control plane # # execute on control plane ferryctl control-plane init Declares to the control plane which data plane needs to join # # execute on control plane to pre-join other data plane ferryctl control-plane pre-join direct cluster-1 If the network environment is more complex, please refer to Join Mode</description></item></channel></rss>
